# **Doctor Web Portal**

### This is a Doctor Web Portal where Admin can register Doctors and Patients while also allocating Patients to Doctors. Doctors on logging in can view the list of patients allotted to them.

### I have used PHP for backend, HTML and CSS for frontend and MySQL for database.

### You can copy the project files in your local development environment, you need to have xampp installed on your pc and make sure it's up and running. Enter "localhost/filename" as url in your preferred browser to see the website.   

## The homepage offers two choices: logging in either as an admin or as a doctor.

## Developed an exclusive Admin Login Panel that directly fetches administrator data from the database, ensuring secure access with a single authorized admin.
